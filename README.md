# Python_and_Statistics_for_Financial_Analysis
This Repo saved my parctices of the Coursera course, Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis.\
For each week practices, I composed them into one.\
The video lectures simply introduce some functions of Python without good exaplainations, so just going through these practices is enough.
For relevant finance and statitics knowledges, it is better to refer other materials.

- **Week 1**: Visualizing and Munging Stock Data
- **Week 2**: Random variables and distribution
- **Week 3**: Sampling and Inference
- **Week 4**: Linear Regression Models for Financial Analysis
